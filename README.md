# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

# Project Overview
This project aims to **predict whether a patient has heart disease** using **Logistic Regression**, a supervised machine learning algorithm.

# Dataset
- File: `heart_disease_dataset.csv`
- Includes features like age, gender, BP, cholesterol, chest pain, etc.

# Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

# Steps Performed
1. Imported libraries  
2. Loaded dataset  
3. Cleaned & preprocessed data  
4. Performed EDA  
5. Selected features  
6. Train-test split  
7. Built Logistic Regression model  
8. Made predictions  
9. Evaluated the model  

# Results
- Accuracy check
